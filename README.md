# TO-DO's for 0.2

* Now that the compiler works, finish getting it to redefine words
* And like I said, I'd like to replace the word `COMPILER` with `SEE`;
* Beyond the compiler....
	- If I'm gonna do `SEE`, may as well use the same technique to implement `CHAR`...
	- I'd kinda like to add `."`, maybe `S"` and `COUNT` and fix `TYPE`
	- Also, I could save a few bytes by adding `ABORT` - there are 3-4 places it would make sense to do that, but not a big deal
* Update my docs :)

# Pa'lante
Version 0.2

## Overview

Pa'lante is a [Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/) interpreter for the following 8-bit computers:

* The Commodore PET (starting in version 0.0)
* The VIC-20 (starting in version 0.1, requires 35K expansion, though if I could decrypt their config-language I might get it working on other VIC setups)
* The C64 (starting in version 0.1)
* The C128 (planned)
* The Plus4 (planned)
* The CBM-II (planned)
* The Commander X16 (planned)
* And when it's done, it might also be portable to other 8-bit systems (I'd kind of like to see Apple II and Atari builds, for example)

My goal is to keep the memory size at under 16K.  Yes I could go lower, but the lower you go the less like Forth you get.  This Git repo is *NOT* my first attempt - oh, there have been many others - so I 've done my research.  I'm all too familiar with those who say you can build a Forth with just 3-4 instructions (`@` `!` and `EXECUTE`).  I could do that, easily, and it would run on just about anything.  But that's more like some kind of strange Assembly REPL than a Forth.  All you can do with that is store binary opcodes in memory and then jump to those addresses.  That's neat, but how do you define new words?  Where's the stack?  Where are `DUP` and `SWAP` and stuff that makes Forth... Forth?  Not that I expect Pa'lante to be fully ANS Forth standard compliant, not that it's gonna have a zillion words out of the box, but I want it to be something a programmer who knows Forth can look at and easily be able to pick up.

## The name

Forth has a rich history of cheesy puns.  With different variants having names like "Blazin' Forth", and countless one-liners like "a Forth to be reconed with" and any opportunity to use words like "Forthcoming" etc.  I love the goofy cheesy fun of it all.  So when I wanted to build my own, I played around with a few names:

* "BreakForth" (cuz Breakaway Forth doesn't sound as cool as Breakaway BASIC - a project I may pick up again someday... or not :D)
* "Skate Forth" (which might end up being my web-based Forth - tho I may not need/want one anymore cuz someone already [beat me to it](https://brendanator.github.io/jsForth/)).

But I'm also fluent in Spanish, and especially familiar with Caribbean (Cuban, Puerto Rican etc.) Spanish slang.  So if you would ask me, how would you translate kingly-sounding phrases like "Let us go Forth" or "I shall go forth"... the translation is obvious.  In "proper" Spanish, Forth would be "para adelante".  But in some places, that get shortened to "pa'delante" or (more commonly) just "pa'lante".  This of course reminds me of a few of my favorite songs: [Vamos Pa'lante!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7TDR9CpQOc), [Voy Pa'lante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK2wySMe_jc) and even [No Vuelvo Pa'tras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slng3XclDQ8) ("pa'tras" being the opposite of pa'lante - rough translation is "I'm not turning back").  Asi que vamos pa'lante! :)

## Road map to version 1.0

The main things I want Pa'lante to have are:

* **The compiler:** This is what I hope to add in version 0.2
* **Branching:** Words like `IF` and `DO` and `BEGIN`
* **File I/O:** Technically already possible with binary opcodes Assembly and `EXECUTE`, but who wants to do that?  I'd like `LOAD`, `SAVE` and (bytes allowing) `VERIFY` like BASIC has.
* **An escape mechanism:**  In durexForth, I can hit RUN/STOP to exit an infinite loop; I'd kinda like to see if there's an interrupt I can listen for, and then if it's triggered set dsp and rsp to zero.

Once it can do all these things, it'll be good enough to be considered a useful development tool.  Faster than BASIC, easier than Assembly, and it runs right on the machine.  At least, that's the dream. :D


## Available words

I'm not going to dive into how Forth works - the link in the "overview" section is really the best place to start.  But what I will do is list the words Pa'lante supports, and extra explanation if they are not "standard" Forth words (like loading/saving files on disk, which of course will be very different on Commodore machines than anything else).

### Standard Forth words

If you know Forth, these do what you think they do. ðŸ˜†  Note that they are case-sensitive - that is, they're lowercase if you're using the lowercase character set, or upper case if you're using that character set.  I used uppercase in my docs just as a convention, but by default they will be lowercase (not sure how I can fix that - it's a compiler thing).

* **Memory:** `C@` `C!` `@` `!`
* **Math:** `+` `-` `*` `/` `MOD` `LSHIFT` `RSHIFT` `AND` `OR` `XOR` `INVERT` `NEGATE`
* **Stack:** `DUP` `SWAP` `OVER` `.` `.S` `EMIT` `DROP` `PICK` `ROLL` `DEPTH`
* **Comparison:** `=` `<>` `<` `<=` `>` `>=`
* **Strings:** `."` `S"` `COUNT` `TYPE`
* **Misc:** `:` `;` `ACCEPT` `BYE` `EXECUTE` `NEXT`


### Before I call 0.2 done...

* `TYPE` needs some work; the issue has to dow ith ASCII vs. PETSCII I think...


### Words I'd like to add in 0.3:

* Comments: `(` `)` and... `\` is a tricky one... Commodore keyboards don't have them... `#` maybe?  `//`?



### Words only included in Pa'lante

* None yet - but I expect a `LOAD` and `SAVE` at least.  Probably `S" MY-FILE,SEQ" 8 LOAD` and `S" @0:MY-FILE,SEQ" 8 SAVE` similar to BASIC.



### Words that won't be written in native code, not available "out of the box"

* I think the rest will be system-dependent and be loaded into disk files (so there'll probably be i.e. SID chip words for the C64 build, character set words for the VIC etc.).
* And if I'm gonna do that, may as well add some more standard Forth words in disk files, like `2DROP` and `2SWAP` and `0=`



### Words I don't plan to do anytime soon

* `VARIABLE` and `CONSTANT`; because I can get the similar results with words that just push numbers on the stack (like `: RED 2 ;` and `: TEXT 646 ;` - I can do `RED TEXT C!` or `TEXT C@ .` like I would with a variable/constant).
* `INCLUDE`, because Commodore's disk API is not like standard Forths; like I said, `LOAD` and `SAVE` will probably work more like in BASIC.
